TEST IMSI used in this feature is a static value programmed by the firmware (http://cgit-legato/sierra-mdm.git/tree/uicc/src/uicctestsim.c#n173) and the module is always expected to come up with IMSI (001010123456789) written in the EFS file. \n\nSo I think explicitly checking the test IMSI value on top of +KSIMSEL? response shall suffice to mark this as PASS.

This method should really be called on a teardown otherwise if any of the asserts hit or test fails we never clean-up the flog.\n\nIf this was a Test Class it would be trivial to add it as a teardown_method, however since LeTP and the FW Integration FW mandate only test methods then we need to use pytest's fixtures. You can create the new fixture that uses an yield vs a return. Anything before the yield is executed at setup time and after the yield at teardown. \n\n  @pytest.fixture\n  def flog_target(target)\n     # maybe do AT!FLOG=2 as a setup as well?\n     # target.run_at_cmd(\"AT!FLOG=2\", 1, [r\"OK\"])\n\n     yield target\n     # anything after the yield is only called on teardown\n     target.run_at_cmd(\"AT!FLOG=2\", 1, [r\"OK\"])\n\nthen rather than using the \"target\" fixture in the test code the new \"flog_target\" fixture should be used. \n\nThis is not that critical for the FLOG case but unless we do correct cleanup procedures we risk interfering with other test cases if this one fails. The above code is how I would do it. Up to you if you want to make this change.

But the idea to only lock the module if it has been unlocked is good, this can be implemented in the future.\n\nThe time.sleep(5) line is also less than ideal since this adds a large delay between each test. The best solution would be an AT command to lock the target again without invoking the back off timer. This can be done with AT!UNLOCK in atlock.c but not in atsp.c which is what the WP modules use."},{"file":"conftest.py","line":34,"reviewer":{"name":"Stoyan Petrov","email":"spetrov@sierrawireless.com","username":"spetrov"},"message":"> Initially the fixture approach was used but the problem with fixtures is that they must be run before testing starts. So there is no flexibility in where in the test the module will be unlocked. But the idea to only lock the module if it has been unlocked is good, this can be implemented in the future.\n\nThat's a good point on the fixture. But touching on Mohit's point, we need a framework to ensure each test module gets the device from a known state. A module scope fixture to force an unlocked device to be locked might be the better approach. We let module's handle their own internal device state, but when that module is done, the framework resets device back to a known state for next module. Otherwise we might end up with flakey tests that only pass/fail if ran before/after certain tests. Can we have a module_teardown module-scope fixture that gets executed at the end of each module (similar to setup_teardown being autouse but at module-scope)? If so then we can check the unlock status, \"at!unlock?\" , \"at!entercnd?\" before locking the device at the end of the module. Other device states might have to be reset, or perhaps do a general NV restore, at a risk of flash wear, but at least we are guaranteeing each test_module.py gets the device from a known state."}],"uploader":{"name":"Michael Lin","email":"MiLin@sierrawireless.com","username":"milin"},"author":{"name":"Michael Lin","email":"MiLin@sierrawireless.com","username":"milin"},"kind":"REWORK","sizeDeletions":0,"createdOn":1606781218,"revision":"e7a8d9cd967232756b0fc8d53598dc57e4c33281","parents":["17f28fb47582a43f8b01a84563dd811c65020316"]},{"number":12,"sizeInsertions":940,"ref":"refs/changes/82/69782/12","comments":[{"file":"atcmd/bs/hw/test_at_bsgpio.py","line":69,"reviewer":{"name":"Stoyan Petrov","email":"spetrov@sierrawireless.com","username":"spetrov"},"message":"I am not sure what python coding standard we are following, but this does not fit well with pep8.
