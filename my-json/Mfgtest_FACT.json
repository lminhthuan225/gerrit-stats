logs\n\nIssue Description:\nSome of the LWM2M credentials is leaked in the logs of FACT.\n\nRoot Cause:\nSome commands in FACT requires echo to be on in the device and some\ncommands in FACT requires echo to be off in the device.\n\nSolution:\nStore the original device echo in FACT and restore the device echo after\nthe AT commands that requires echo to be in a certain state.\n\nLimitation:\nThis only works if there's no issues in between the store and restore of\nAT commands. If there are any issues in between, the echo state of the\ndevice will be lost.\n\nResolves: HSWFACT-264\nChange-Id: I4e9f07a0d095d505d1ea393162254b1292df12fc\n","subject":"[FACT] AirVantage credential leakage in FACT logs","project":"Mfgtest/FACT","branch":"master","createdOn":1648768504,"url":"http://10.107.128.8:8081/c/Mfgtest/FACT/+/83342","number":83342,"lastUpdated":1649182865,"allReviewers":[{"name":"Matthew Law","email":"mlaw@sierrawireless.com","username":"mlaw"},{"name":"Sammy Ng","email":"sng@sierrawireless.com","username":"sng"},{"name":"CARMD-EV-GIT01_sa","username":"carmd-ev-git01_sa"}],"topic":"HSWFACT-264","id":"I4e9f07a0d095d505d1ea393162254b1292df12fc","open":false,"status":"MERGED","patchSets":[{"number":1,"sizeInsertions":115,"ref":"refs/changes/42/83342/1","uploader":{"name":"Matthew Law","email":"mlaw@sierrawireless.com","username":"mlaw"},"author":{"name":"Matthew Law","email":"mlaw@sierrawireless.com","username":"mlaw"},"kind":"REWORK","sizeDeletions":14,"approvals":[{"by":{"name":"CARMD-EV-GIT01_sa","username":"carmd-ev-git01_sa"},"grantedOn":1648768506,"description":"Quality-Check","type":"Quality-Check","value":"-2"}],"createdOn":1648768504,"revision":"0a1affddfd565d6c9f5d6a9dde20f7df9f0f403b","parents":["d29a1295cb6bbce8f1bc5b66e4a6e0e41df5d761"]},{"number":2,"sizeInsertions":115,"ref":"refs/changes/42/83342/2","uploader":{"name":"Matthew Law","email":"mlaw@sierrawireless.com","username":"mlaw"},"author":{"name":"Matthew Law","email":"mlaw@sierrawireless.com","username":"mlaw"},"kind":"NO_CODE_CHANGE","sizeDeletions":14,"createdOn":1648768916,"revision":"90d5bce2df7663ea472c72ebb6d1dca738da3a95","parents":["d29a1295cb6bbce8f1bc5b66e4a6e0e41df5d761"]},{"number":3,"sizeInsertions":115,"ref":"refs/changes/42/83342/3","comments":[{"file":"/PATCHSET_LEVEL","line":0,"reviewer":{"name":"Sammy Ng","email":"sng@sierrawireless.com","username":"sng"},"message":"Under FACTDut.cpp line 2388, I think you want to restore echo before you postthreadmessage.
